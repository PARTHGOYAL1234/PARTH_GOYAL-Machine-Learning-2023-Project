Problem Statement/Goal -Problem Statement/Goal -The "FinTech" firm has introduced its Android and iOS mobile application and aims to expand its business. However, they face a challenge in effectively promoting the app and targeting users who genuinely desire to use it. To tackle this issue, the company has come up with a strategy: offering a free trial to every customer for 24 hours while gathering valuable data from them. Based on the data analysis, the company observes that some customers make a purchase, while others do not. Leveraging this information, the company plans to provide special offers to those customers who showed no interest in buying initially, thus fostering business growth.

This is an classification type problem
